## Project Overview

This project is a front-end website that examines how current copyright laws fall short when it comes to AI-generated voice cloning. The site is designed to resemble a modern digital newspaper, using a clean layout and interactive pop-up articles to present information in a clear, engaging way.

## Motivation

I built this project to explore a timely issue at the intersection of technology, creativity, and policy while practicing full front-end development from design to implementation. I wanted to create a site that feels familiar to everyday readers but polished and modern enough to appeal to technical audiences, with a strong focus on usability, layout, and visual clarity.
